## Making a script global ##
############################

1. See what your echo $PATH output is. For me it included /usr/local/sbin/
2. Make your script that you make global by putting it in that folder.

-In the current folder there is some input that can be used as a demonstration. It includes the output of export -p
-The program that was added as global is named myEnv. It takes as input an argument and displays lines from that argument that have project or default in it.
-Illustrator works as following: myEnv myFile
-You need to add executeable rights to the script with chmod +x or by adding 1 to privilages of those who you want to make the script available for.
-You may need to use sudo to be able to copy the script to the /usr/local/sbin dir.
