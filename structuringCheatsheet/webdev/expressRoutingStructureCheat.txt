-Idea is to group some routes together based on some logic

<projectRoot>/routes/shelters.js {
 const express = require('express');
 const router = express.Router();
 
//Things that use GET or POST
 /shelters
 /shelters/:id
 /shelters/:id/edit
 
 module.exports = router;
}

<projectRoot>/index.js {
 const something = require('./routes/shelters.js');
 app.use('/someprefixname', something);
}

<projectRoot>/routers/admin.js {
 router.use(somesyntaxhellhere);
 router.post('/something');
 router.get('/somethingElse');
 //It is possible to route all traffic through router.use line. Idea is to try to do a check of authenticy and authority. At the time of creation, I was in #484
}
