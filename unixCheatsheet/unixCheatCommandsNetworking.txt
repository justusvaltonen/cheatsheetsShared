https://linuxconfig.org/configuring-virtual-network-interfaces-in-linux		--> How to create VNIC
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_Inter-process_Communication		--> Service-based management. Think firewalls with some other rulesets than regular
https://www.baeldung.com/linux/network-interface-configure			--> Config interfaces
https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/10/22/introduction-to-linux-interfaces-for-virtual-networking	--> RedHat version of Great explanation


bridge				--> Tool for bridging. See man bridge
ethtool				--> Configure all sorts of cool stuff. See ethtool
ip add          		--> Other version of ifconfig
ip link				--> Shows links
ip link set name		--> When creating virtual NIC, you can rename with this
ip maddr			--> Multicast address info
ip neigh			--> Shows topologically neighbouring addresses
ip route		        --> Some routing tables
ip tunnel			--> Shows active tunnels
iptables			--> Utility that has networking management stuff
nc				--> NetCat
nmap				--> To discover hosts on network
rsync				--> Remote sync files. If one needs to use a DB for example
ss -l				--> Shows linstening sockets. See man ss for more info

sudo nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24	--> Discover hosts on the network
sudo arp-scan -l		--> Discover hosts on local network. Noisy

curl -4 icanhazip.com		--> Whatsmyip output
___________________________
ufw	--> UbuntuFirewall:
---------------------------
The command needs root privilages. After first example, we assume all commands have sudo in front.
sudo ufw status		--> Shows current rules

Run in ~/.ssh
sftp -v -i <privateKey> <user>@<hostOrIP>
ssh -v -i <privateKey> <savedHostConfig>

Run at host when logged as sftp:
get <somefile>			--> Fetches to current location. Use ! to see local machine.

Better Struckture Listing:

atop				--> Better than top, different from htop
curl -4 icanhazip.com		--> Outputs same as whats my ip google search
dig				--> DNS lookup tool.
firewalld			--> Said to be alternative to ufw
htop				--> More h4x| interface to top
iostat				--> CPU monitoring and I/O monitoring.
ip				--> Shows landing page of ip family
ipsec				--> Guessing something to do with VPN
lsof				--> List files belonging to processes
mtr				--> Said to combine traceroute and ping
netstat				--> Networking things
nft				--> NetworkFirewallTables. Tool like ufw or iptables
nmap				--> Tool for network scanning
nmon				--> Tool to inspect current system
ping				--> Basic pinging tool
route -n			--> Shows some routing info
sar				--> System reporting tool
scp				--> SecureCoPy. Don't know how secure. Guessing pretty secure. SSH stuff.
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward	--> Shows your IP-Forwarding status
tcpdump				--> Tool that Wireshark utilizes I believe. Get NIC traffic to a file.
top				--> Process list. Crappy version of htop
traceroute			--> Shows some routing info. Amount of hops to a point for example
ufw				--> Ubuntu Firewall. Uncomplicated FireWall
vmstat				--> Virtual Memory STATistics tool
