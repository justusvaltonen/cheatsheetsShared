___________
GoodToKnow:
-You have a symbol in your command-line that usually tells you what privilages you have atm or other stuff:
$		--> Normal
#		--> Root
~		--> You are at $HOME (home directory of the user you are logged in as)
/etc/apt	--> You are at absolutePath* /etc/apt/

-You can have something like:
[someUsername@computerName ~]$
--> You are logged in as someUsername, you are logged in computerName, your current path is ~ that is your users home directory	-->
-bash-5.1$
--> Configuration shows name of shell* and the shells version instead. Bash is a general shell*

-Command prompt you use is actually a variable by the name $PS1
--> echo $PS1 to see some definitions. Warning! Hard to read at first

Runnning the following could display the following...
-bash-5.1$ echo $PS1		--> Outputs	-->
\s-\v\$
-->
\s	== Shell
\v	== Version

-Syntax for this is hard, but logical. One needs to google more to understand properly
-You can see your variables that are enabled in your current session by typing: set
set | grep PS	--> Shows only variables and settings that have PS written in them. You most likely have multiple PS instances...*

-Settings of bash are located in: ~/.bashrc	among other places. <Home dir>/.bashrc file. Hidden files are files that start with .
-Look at your hidden files in current directory by typing: ls -la
--> To see what that means: man ls
