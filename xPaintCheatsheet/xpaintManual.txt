##Greatness of xpaint. My journy of discovery

+++RandomNotes+++
-The thing starts a new window for basically everything so Alt+Tab is very useful. Maybe even good to run the thing in a different desktop.
-From one window you can choose your weapon-type and the board-window has some additional specs and features.
-First I'll make my canvas 2560x1920 in size. Time will tell if it's plenty enough
-Using different colors is a good thing.
-We can reference different expansions with an ID system, so why not create one. We can use colors, shapes, text or maybe effects as tags.
-

+++Board-Window+++
-TopLeft eye-icon let's you choose a color from where you click and select that as your output color
-Width of the brush can be selected as a number value from the board-window from the long line up-top. Starting width was 1.
-To delete something you selected with the select-tool, go to edit/clear
-Using the select-tool and not clicking out of it will leave a padding that can't be crossed
-

+++ToolsWindow+++
-Be careful with the select-tool (blue background) since it may overwrite your picture if you select too big of an area

"Blue : Backups"; 		--> Because starts with the letter 'B'
"Red : Danger(			--> Be careful when handling because something might break.
  Variables, Scripts
)";
"Green : Experiment";		--> Do what you will in here
"BabyShitBrown : Sourcing";	--> Something that is referenced at regular basis

+++ShapeLogic+++
-Squarish == Directory/Folder
-Round edges == File
-Line (pretty or not) == Connection between 2 items. Coloring defines what kind of connection
-Line with arrows == Where arrow points to is the sub-item.
