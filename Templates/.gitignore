## To enable / disable ignoring of a file toggle '#' in front of an entry
## Hidden files that should be kept hidden.
.credentials
#.DS_Store
#.env
.exclude
.excludes
#.gitignore
.git-credential
.git-credentials
.secrets

## Files that expose too much but are not hidden, may cause harm or just useless files
*.log
*.log*
*~

## Not sure if these are ever going to be shared by accident, but feels that I would restrict some if not all of these.

~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg
~/.local/share/
~/.mozilla/*
~/.npm/*
~/.pki/*
~/.ssh/*

# The following doesn't work because the dir is ignored already. Precedence is a thing here aswell 
# !NoGood/
# ? is replacing one char
# **/exampledir/*.suf	Excludes all files and dirs ending with '.suf' inside exampledir and subdirs
# There can be multiple .gitignore files and can be put to any dir
# Remove already committed file from tracked list: git rm --cached <filename>
# Make things global for your current user: git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore
# Something not working and you want to inspect: git check-ignore -v <filename>
