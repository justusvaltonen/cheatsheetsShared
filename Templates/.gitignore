# The following doesn't work because the dir is ignored already. Precedence is a thing here aswell 
# !NoGood/
# ? is replacing one char
# **/exampledir/*.suf	Excludes all files and dirs ending with '.suf' inside exampledir and subdirs
# There can be multiple .gitignore files and can be put to any dir
# Remove already committed file from tracked list: git rm --cached <filename>
# Make things global for your current user: git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore
# Something not working and you want to inspect: git check-ignore -v <filename>
