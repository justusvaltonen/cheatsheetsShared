=============================================================

-- Statistical things --

Rules of thumb:
-Omaha with 4 cards is 6 * combos that are available in texas more or less





Sytax:
C						== Combinations
 C(sizeOfSet, howManyThingsWeWantFromTheSet)
P						== Probability of some thing
 P(PocketAcesPLO)

RedefinedWords:
Good						== Describes strength of a hand. Not sure how to define since I don't know the thoughts of youtube guy. Good < Great
Great						== Comparison between other abstract terms. Good < Great






How often do pocket aces appear?

Source #1
1 / 39 == 0.025641026
--> 2.56%, Not sure where the answer comes from, but one guess is:
--> (Combos where 2 are in a set of 4) * (Combos where 2 are in a set of 48) / Combos where 4 are in a set of 52
--> C(4,2) * C(48,2) / C(52,4)
--> How to calculate, is a mystery. This example assumes that AAA is not a valid hand as aces

Source #2	- Bad and no explanation
31,44% / 13 == 2.418461538
--> 2,42%, doesn't include AAA or AAAA, Not at all sure where the math comes from in this one

Source #3
4/52 * 3/51 * 6 == 6/221 ==> 0.027149321
--> 2,71%, If any AA is good then this should apply and be valid

4 / 52 ==> 1 / 13		--> Hit an ace the first time
3 / 51 ==> 1 / 17		--> Hit the ace second time. A bit off since if fails then has 3 / 50, again if fails gets 3 / 49

13 * 17 == 221			--> Correct answer should be about 1 / 221, so this is an interesting result

6 * 13 == 78			--> Non-relating most likely, but just wanted to roll the numbers a bit. Don't know why we should be obsessed with multiplying by six
6 * 17 == 102			--> Non-relating most likely, but just wanted to roll the numbers a bit

3 * 4 == 12
51 * 52 == 2652
2652 / 12 == 221		--> Another way to reach the same number as before. This is propably the magic number of propability to get aces in Holdem

Source #4
Total possible starting hands:		6 497 400 ( /24 = 270 725 combos)
Exactly 2 aces:				6 768 (2.4999538%)
Exactly 3 aces:				144	--> To 192
Exactly 4 aces:				1
At least 2 aces:			6 913 (2.5535137%)
Compare to holdem * 6 ==> 6/221 = 2.714932%



Random semi-useless trivia:

Number of starting hands (not combos and no suits are taken in concideration):		16 432
Maximum wrap hits of times:								68%
3-card maxwrap hits of times:								60%
Three pairs to full house:								24%
Two pairs to full house:								16.5%
Against avg hand equitys:
 AAKK DS										73%
 AAKK rainbow										68%
 AA77 DS										72%
 AA77 rainbow										67%
 AAJT DS										76%
 AAJT rainbow										71%
 JT98 DS										56%
 JT98 rainbow										49%
 
Hit the turn 2.22% * number_of_outs
Hit your draw on turn or river: number_of_outs * 2 * (2.27 logX, where X increases based on your outs by a small fraction)

-- Useful trivia for future math, but not fact checked --

Source: Youtube / #PokerStatistician / "Pot Limit Omaha Probabilities and Ranges"
Scenario: PLO-4
Do the calculus the validate. The guy in the video is not in any way convincing and this seems like lazy math - that is ok if somewhat correct
Also there is all the info available to deduct the information needed. Just watch the video and think. We do have to assume that the abstract formulas are correct though

## Starting hands
let anyAA = GettingAces()				== ~2.5% 	||	1 / 40
 anyAA.handIsRainbow()					== ~12.77%	||	1 / 8
 anyAA.handHasSingleSuitHelper()			== ~74.46%	||	3 / 4
 anyAA.handHasDoubleSuitHelper()			== ~12.77%	||	1 / 8

let anyHand = GetAllHandCombos()
 anyHand.isDoublePair()					== ~1.04%	||	1 / 96
 anyHand.isDoubleSuit()					== ~13.48%	||	1 / 7
 
let singleA = anyHand.GetOnlyOneAce()
 singleA.aceIsSuited()					== ~15.01%	||	1 / 7

getting a rundown:					== ~1.23%	||	1 / 81


## Example ranges

1) From the video: Nit/Fish UTG Range -- We use !NFUR_1 from now on since there is no reason why not.
def 7, 8 = Good, Great;
!NFUR_1 = [
"AAxx", "Ka Kb Xa Xb", "Ka Kb Na Nn -7", "KaKbXcXd -8", "Qa Qb Na Nb -7", "Qa Qb Na Nc -8", "Ja Jb Na Nb -8", "XaXbYaYb", "XaXbYaYc -7",
"XaXbYcYd -8", "rundown-ds", "AaNaNbNb -8", "Aa, 3-broadways where 1 suits with ace"
]
  ==> About 7%

2) From the video: Ivey UTG Or Nit/Fish Cutoff Range -- We use !IUONFCOR_1
!IUONFCOR_1 = [
"TTXX++", "XXYY", "rundown", "rundown+1s-1gap", "XdXYdZ", "rundown+ds-2gap", "VVWX+ds-1gap", "AaNaNnNn", "KXXX+ds-7", "3-broadway+ss"
]
  ==> About 40%

=============================================================

-- To avoid tilting notes to self --

Evaluation order:
1. Nuttiness
2. Connectivity
3. Suits you sir
--> Missing one of the most important: Playability in your situation. Mid-bucket hand with 35bb in an active table can lead to many situations. Bad AA UTG is trouble since all thinks you have AA.

Categorize things:
isA_high()
is_wrappy()
 has_gaps()
 has_big_gaps()
is_masked()
works_multiway()
early_strong() --> button_strong()
has_good_story_value()
has_dangler()
broadway_musical()
has_jtxx_and_is_playable()
blocks_own_draw()
has_pair()		--> Hi, mid, lo?
<all possible suite querys>
<how large of a portion of all playable hands some category represents>
<would some nit guy open the selected category from UTG?>
<if you can't give an example of the range of a category, you need to refactor to smaller categories>


Dos and Dont's:
-Don't FPS if that is what you're doing
-Pay attention
-UTG openers have aces most of the time
-Anyone 3-betting usually has aces. Plan for all of the streets
-One way is to play hands that you could go allin with in the first place.

-Early:
 -Avoid multiway
 -Select good hands
 -Try to find an opening to jam
-Mid:
 -Don't call UTG raisers
 -Don't get squeezed
 -Do get squeezed if that's your plan ==> Play multiway hands and don't be afraid to invest a lot

-Define a playable MP range and see how big of a portion is aces
