OK, starting off with some trouble. My updater hasen't finished for some reason.
    ps aux
-Shows that there is a hanging process of 6050 that runs apt upgrade and update. Because of that, I can't do much.
    sudo kill -9 6050
-Makes the problem go away

    apt list --installed
-Shows that I have my required libs in place

    npm install --prefix Season-2/Level-4/ Season-2/Level-4/ && npm install --global mocha
-Appeared to do something, but no idea what. Maybe mocha I understand. It is a testing thing if I remember correctly. Yes, alternative would be jest

-Using the VSCode on Codespaces. I see that there is a mention in Season-2/Level-4/package-lock.json

S1 - L1
Season 1 - Level 1: Cyber Monday

Finally finding something instructive. There was something going on with the workflow dir, but couldn't get the hang of it.
Now at ~/Season-1/README.md

-Storyline states that I need to fix something. Hmm... there is a mention that indicates that I need to bypass testcases while doing what I'm here to do.

For each level, you will find the same file structure:
    code        includes the vulnerable code to be reviewed.
    hack        exploits the vulnerabilities in code. Running hack.py will fail initially, your goal is to get this file to pass.
    hint        offers a hint if you get stuck.
    solution    provides one working solution. There are several possible solutions.
    tests       contains the unit tests that should still pass after you have implemented your fix.


Time to start!
    Review the code in code.py. Can you spot the bug(s)?
    Try to fix the bug. Ensure that unit tests are still passing ðŸŸ¢.
    You successfully completed the level when both hack.py and tests.py pass ðŸŸ¢.
    If you get stuck, read the hint in the hint.js file.
    Compare your solution with solution.py.



While in the terminal inside my codespace, I try the normal
    ./code.py
But it doesn't work.
Next I make the file executable by chmod +x <filename>
Then the UI says that something needs installing. So I install it.
Next there is a mention in "PROBLEMS" in the same place where the terminal is, but on another tab. There it gives me linenumbers.
First 2 problems were with having an extra space in call of collections inside our __init__.py file that is somewhere inside our system where the libs are kept
-It is a huge file, but thanks for our IDE, finding the bug is fast and easy

-So it was that the bug wasn't it. Still getting the same error:

: No such file or directory
from: can't read /var/mail/collections
./code.py: line 16: syntax error near unexpected token `('
./code.py: line 16: `Order = namedtuple('Order', 'id, items');'

-When I paint the word collections and right click, I get to see declaration and definition of it or so I think.
-Can't seem to understand intuitively what the definition does. Looking at the first line helps the most, maybe.


Tuple is a thing in python. It's a list that is sorted with some logic. We can not change the order, once it's written down.
    myvariable = ("cat", "dog", "hummingbird")
-Tuples are defined inside (), usually that is.

    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
-The above is also allowed with multiple entrys that are the same.

    my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
    my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
    my_tuple = 1, "Hello", 3.4
-All are valid statements


On line 16 of code.py, there is a capital letter used. Should that mean something?
The lines are:
    Order = namedtuple('Order', 'id, items')
    Item = namedtuple('Item', 'type, description, amount, quantity')
Things that hurt my brain are:
-Capital letter on variable creation
-Not knowing how '"` and others behave, is there a problem with the parsing?
-Some styling guidance can be found at (3)
-Chatbot states that the capitalized Order is a class and order is a variable name. Why do we want to pass hardcoded values to our class definition?
-Are we somehow building the base of our object with a funny looking syntax? Tuples can't be changed BTW

-Things don't give me sensible output, I needed to restart the Virtual-VS-Code. Now I see there are new dirs popping up. Some .venv dir that wasn't there before, now exists.



-Let's see if our diff is still bugging out. No it wasn't. Now I can't seem to do just about anything right. Got to take a nap
