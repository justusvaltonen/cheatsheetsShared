-There are 2 types of access tokens: Personal (Classic) and Fine-grained personal access tokens.
-Classic tokens have the scope of the whole account. At least by default.
-There are some visual aids in (1.0) to help you out.
-You can use GithubCLI, but the installation itself seems like a handful. (2.0)
-You can also use git-credential-manager (3.0)
-You can also access github using SSH. This has to be easy. (4.0)


(1.0)
-Go to your profile on top-right corner in github.com when logged in.

Fine-grained token: {
 Settings/DeveloperSettings/PersonalAccessTokens/Fine-grainedTokens(beta): (B) new token
TokenName: 
Expiration: 90 days
Description: 
ResourceOwner: 
RepositoryAccess
 OnlySelectedRepositories: justusvaltonen/<classified>
Permissions
 RepositoryPermissions
  Denied: {"CodespaceMetadata","CodespaceSecrets","DependabotAlerts","DependabotSecrets"}
   --> Only because I'm sick of this shit for now. Fix these on some important repos.
 AccountPermissions

GeneratedToken: <your-token-here>
}

PersonalAccessToken: {

}

-You should be good to go replacing your password with your token from now on:
$ git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
Username: YOUR_USERNAME
Password: YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN

-Personal access tokens can only be used for HTTPS Git operations. If your repository uses an SSH remote URL, you will need to switch the remote from SSH to HTTPS. (1.2)


(4.1)
$ ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
 --> -T == "Disable pseudo-terminal allocation", whatever that means. Will fail by default

-You need to enable SSH authentication, create a key-pair, set remote to use SSH instead of HTTPS and then the following should work
git clone ssh://git@ssh.github.com:443/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPOSITORY>.git
