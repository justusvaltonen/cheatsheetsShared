## How to read these tutorials

This side of the manuals is new to me also, so written as learning. Also markdown is new to me. I wanted to create a tree-map of this dir that would automatically change as the structure changed, but this is not a priority, so skipping.

### Skills section

This holds not so much as a cheatsheet, since everything was done using GH WebUI and duplicating things seems stupid. Use https://github.com/skills/ as a source.
