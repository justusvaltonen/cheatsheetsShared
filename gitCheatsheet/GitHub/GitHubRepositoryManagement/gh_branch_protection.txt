SIMILAR DOCUMENTING IN ANOTHER FILE. SOURCES ARE ALMOST THE SAME

__________________
Branch protection:  (C)(C1)(C2)(C3)
-Available on public repos
-Needs "edit repository rules" permissions to edit the rules
-Branch level rules
-Pattern specified in: 'fnmatch' describes what is affected. Use regex or equivelant. Wildcards exist.
-Possibly using Ruby as language
-Priorities resemble firewall behaviour slightly
-Check phase 6 from (C1). Didn't understand possibly. Maybe the merge is operated to a past timeline or something. Just don't select the option and it's easier... :D
-The option "Require a pull request before merging" should be ticked.
-"Require approvals" may be a thing that is used if the process is not automated. Because only trying to get something done, I won't require this one.
    --> I am the one who does the merging and inspecting, so this seems a bit pointless. It's good to see what happens tho.
-"Allow specified actors to bypass required pull request" seems sensible when not collaborating yet, but since someone is using my account, I think I'll leave this unticked.
    --> Besides, I don't have this even as an option.
-"Require status checks to pass before merging" seems a lot like email settings. You can add some status checks mentioned in (C2) that need passing.
-"Require conversation resolution before merging" will be ignored at this time. I don't have signatures yet and no conversation is being made in this stage.
-Managing merge problems can be done by a technique called "merge queue" solving. (C3.1)
-"Do not allow bypassing the above settings" seems like a sensible setting, so forces can't be executed by just anyone. Admins and "bypass security" feature on your character still enables using free gitting.
-You can protect the repo from yourself on the bottom of the page. If you don't allow force push, then something needs doing before pushes can be done.


Quotes:
"Because GitHub uses the File::FNM_PATHNAME flag for the File.fnmatch syntax, the * wildcard does not match directory separators (/). For example, qa/* will match all branches beginning with qa/ and containing a single slash, but will not match qa/foo/bar. You can include any number of slashes after qa with qa/**/*, which would match, for example, qa/foo/bar/foobar/hello-world. You can also extend the qa string with qa**/**/* to make the rule more inclusive."


-Alright, my first rule got created. Not sure if everything is blocked now. Time to do a very short test:
Git complained that a file will be overwritten if merge is done instantly. So I rename the file and do a diff with the 2 versions and there is no difference...

The next thing failing was:
---------------------------
Total 9 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: error: GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/officialbranch.
remote: error: Changes must be made through a pull request.
To https://github.com/justusvaltonen/miniprograms.git
 ! [remote rejected] officialbranch -> officialbranch (protected branch hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/justusvaltonen/miniprograms.git'

-Oh yea, I believe that push doesn't cut it. Pull request needs to be generated somehow...
-I have a hunch that this has to be done from WebUI
-Changed Linear stuff to disabled. Let's see what happens. Well, nothing.

-(C3.3) explains to some degree on how to create a request on the CLI
git request-pull [-p] <start> <URL> [<end>]

-When unticking: "Require a pull request before merging", all seems to work again.

CONCLUTION, CONTINUE FROM AND FOLLOW UP:
-I got merge to happen from WebUI by clicking just something. I have to say I didn't understand what I was doing. Seemed that there was at least 2 merges required.
-This is not the easiest of tasks. Maybe just following the skill pages would be easier...
