-This file describes my learning with git and github.
-Story is told as commandline commands and maybe a bit of GUI usage aswell

################################################################################################

***I am at my home-pc command line***
1)
git pull https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git
    --> Asks for username and password, so not the correct move. I haven't setup accesskeys yet. No more password authentication. Tokens need to be used...
    --> Going to github and googling for instructions on setting up your own 'fine grained access tokens' will cause confusion if this is your first time...

2)
git remote add original https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git
    --> No complains. Seems ok.
    --> Remote is a repository somewhere else than your home network. Now it refers to github.
    --> Using the add is good or bad. Because I'm 'original', I try to alias that in to my UI.

3)
git remote -v
    --> Displays that the URL has indeed being set to 'original' alias.

4)
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git
    --> Asks for username and password and says that I have no write access: 403
    --> I must have misconfigured my token. I need to go to github/settings/developersettings to add more power!

5)
https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens?apiVersion=2022-11-28
    --> Maybe setting up the permissions according to this guideline helps. Annoying as hell. See pull requests on the right and figure if that helps

6)
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<reponame>.git
    --> When I use the classic token, I get to pull the things. Doesn't seem right to me.
    --> Somehow the dir is now nested inside another root, so I have .git ./<reponame>/.git and this pisses me off.

7)
git add git_abstract_copyfortesting.txt
    --> The testfile I was supposed to push
    --> Eventually this succeeded, not when I was initially doing this. Starting over happens too often...

8)
git commit -m "only to see structure of push"
    --> Because I haven't setup my email and other things, I get nowhere. I get the message:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Author identity unknown

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got '*******************')
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


***Still on my home-pc***
9)
git config --global user.email "<your-mail-here>"
git config --global user.name "<Author Name>"
    --> I use my personal mail and my real name. At this point I don't know why it matters.

10)
git commit -m "only to see structure of push"

[master (root-commit) 2fb7b48] only to see structure of push
 1 file changed, 39 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 git_abstract_copyfortesting.txt
    --> I thought that I made master go away. Master is flattering, or so it sounds.
    --> Really it's the default name that your branch uses. I wasn't aware of it at this time.

11)
git log
commit 2fb7b4830d80c13a1e31b18df18d7ff6e0a119d0 (HEAD -> master)
Author: <Author Name> <your-mail-here>
Date:   Tue Nov 28 11:11:40 2023 +0200

    only to see structure of push
    --> What the hell is this HEAD? Why is it shouting?
    --> It has something to do with tracking of local state of your repository or not. At least things are happening.

12)
git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	<reponame>/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    --> Weird that I have something I'm not tracking.
    --> This adding of some files needs to be done to tell git what to send to the server. For some reason I didn't realize this. Resting is important.

13)
git push
fatal: No configured push destination.
Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using

    git remote add <name> <url>

and then push using the remote name

    git push <name>

    --> Till this day I don't understand why the remote repository wasn't configured on my pc.
    --> Usually after cloning or whenever a .git (hidden) dir is created, all that is needed comes with that.

14)
git remote show
original
    --> This command displays the alias that I earlier specified.
    --> I was under the impression that the remote repository was bound now. Most likely 'original' referred to my local repository

15)
git push original
    --> Had at least some sort of an effect
    --> It looked to the untrained eye that pushing was done and it was. Only it was to my local version and not the remote...

-----------------------------------------------------
-On GUI there is some action. I can't seem to figure out what the GUI want's me to do..
-There has been an upload to github, but when I try to pull to another location, the previously verified push is not included

    --> I don't fully understand what happened here. It may be that some version info gets posted, but the files themself are not moving.
    --> This is a story of failing badly because lacking experience. At least I know a bit better now what there is to be done.
