-Go to github.com and sign in
-Add new repository. Name is cheatsheets and the repo is private
-Address for the repo is: https://github.com/justusvaltonen/<reponame>.git
-The following is a copypaste from github webpage:

echo "# cheatsheets" >> README.md
 --> Creates a readme file and appends to the empty file the line: # cheatseets

git init
 --> Getting a message (message_1) as output. Inits current location as root for your files.

git add README.md
 --> Adds the new file to a list of followed and possibly to be pushed files. No sending yet. Adding is called staging.

git status
 --> Shows status of your files added and not added, starting from your path where you did git init

git commit -m "first commit"
 --> Commits to be pushed the files that are added. You can set a message here that will be visible

git branch -M mastery
 --> Not sure. See git-branch for more info

git remote add origin https://github.com/justusvaltonen/<reponame>.git
 --> I'm guessing this sets the source to a remote location. Because the URL starts with https, we can see that we don't use SSH, but HTTPS as remote url type

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<owner>/<repository>.git
git remote -v
 --> Should display the remote repository url. You now replace your password with your personal access token.

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<owner>/<repository>.git
 --> Enables SSH authentication again if that is wanted.
 --> In these examples "origin" refers to some remote repository name
 --> You can see what is in use with git remote -v

git remote rename origin somename
 --> Keep in mind that the remotes name will be affected on your local machine, not neccessarily on the github.

git remote add remoterepositorynameone https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>
git remote -v
 --> Should add remote repository for you to use.

git push -u <remote-name> <branch-name>
git push -u origin mastery
 --> Gives (message_2)
 --> Once the steps to set up access tokens are done, this works. Insert the access token when asked for a password
 --> -u == For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less git-pull(1) and other commands. So no idea.
