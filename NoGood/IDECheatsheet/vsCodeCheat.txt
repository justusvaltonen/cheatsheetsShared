## Time to learn and take note of some stuff from VSCode ##

-- Application.Walkthrough.BoostYourProductivity --

(SideBySideEditing)
-Press Alt + Splitting image to split Up and Down

(WatchYourCodeInAction)
-There was a folder called .vscode added to my project. Inside that there is a file called launch.json that seems to be a launcher config thing for debugging. I prefer to write the isntructions myself possibly
-There is a button "Add Configuration" that adds some JSON that seems to do some automated testing
-Some mentions about intellisense

(TrackYourCodeWithGit).(InitializeGitRepository)
-It states 7605 changes made. That may be true since I have no Git repos defined. Don't know where this guy would put the files.
-WARNING! don't click on discard changes or you may end up deleting the tracked files. This one is tested.
-I got the tracking to go away by somehow closing a repository
-Only way to disable Git tracking was to create a .gitignore file and put * as content.

(AutomateYourProjectTasks).(RunAuto-DetectedTasks)
-Basic things. I don't get why VSCode wants to be involved in these manual steps.


-- Application.Walkthrough.GetStartedWithVSCode --
-Nothing of intrest.


There are many things that can be used. Also many features that can be moved to vim or some other editor.

-- Personal notes --
--------------------

-You can right click on a folder and choose settings to find cool things inside.
-If you end up pressing F11, you go to full screen mode and this may fuckup the menus in top. Press Alt to view them
-ZenMode = (Ctrl + KZ). Shortcut doesn't work, but can be returned from by pressing Alt. ZenMode gets rid of all sorts of informative panels and leaves you only with an editor.
-You can search recently opened files by Ctrl + P
