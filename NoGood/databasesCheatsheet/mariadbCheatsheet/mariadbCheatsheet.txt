MySQL



Commands:
sudo mysql --version
 --> mysql  Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.3.38-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using readline 5.2

ss -nlt
 --> Shows Secure Sockets? Anyway, 3306 is what we're intrested in.

sudo systemctl status mariadb
 --> Seems that I have mariadb running.

sudo systemctl status mysql
 --> It also seems that I have mysql running.
