# cheatsheetsShared
Commands and terminology memorization outsourced. Not properly maintained.

1) Files should contain the source of information and proper instructions. Interweb is full of bad documentation. I will try to do better.
2) Access should be handled with tokens that have limited lifecycle.
3) Each machine that has access should have it's personal token. Depending who is granted access, different permissions will be used.
4) To do list should be one that is general. No personal stuff. Personal stuff should be kept away from GitHub.
5) Messy personal notes should be kept in a different repo. Only easy to understand memos. Unfinished, but understandable memos are ok.
6) It is tempting to post bigger pieces of code in this repo, but they have their own place. It's possible that this repo will be almost empty because of that.

______
To Do:

-Create lateral backups inside github and learn the basic usage

-Make some sense of the tokens. There is a lot of info to be found on the docs. Way too much for my liking. Once there is a need to use different methods, add a manual.
  --> Some of the tokens are just plain bad. Some are good. How to use on application level is a thing that could interest. Leaking data seems to become an issue very easilly.
  --> One thing is to automate refresh of cached creds. This is how happens in many protocols.
  --> I predict that I will find a way of doing things better in the near future.

-Clean the local versions of cheatsheets and remove extras. Backup first of course.
  --> Too much to ask and maintain. Just generally keep it tidy

-Feel free to improve the manuals any time. Maybe even integrating to readme could work

-Keep tree map available and updated at all times

-Things relating to networking is a large topic that needs to be triplechecked. This is time consuming, but is good to do.

-Create your own styling guide to github. Use others as reference

-Rewrite you own fingerprint rules. Create the CLI-tool later. It may take some time. Have the program take in the settings as parameter so anyone can make their own language.

-Who/what is accessing my account?

-Win the skills.github.com

-Create a vault of some sort. At least get credential.helper <custom> to work

-Create an easy way of migrating away from GH and other service providers. One should always have at least 2 providers occupied and 2 extra options waiting for a catastrophy

-How did the varials transfer again between apps? How about other data. I've had some problems with some excel format. Use many passpoints and alternative routes to move data
