#TODO FILE

-Make some sense of the tokens. There is a lot of info to be found on the docs. Way too much for my liking. Once there is a need to use different methods, add a manual.

-Clean the local versions of cheatsheets and remove extras. Backup first of course.

-Feel free to improve the manuals any time.

-Keep tree map available and updated at all times
