1) SEO looks for  "Title Tags" and "Meta Descriptions"  nowdays
2) Words need to reflect the content of your page
	--> This is the question I'm looking answers for. How is it calculated?
3) Don't use more than 10 keywords
4) Not sure if one should include or leave out common miss-spellings of keywords.
5) Using some longer strings may actually come in handy if you get it right
6) Use of plurals may be useful
7) If you can find out what are the search words that lead people to your site, it would be cool. Analytics and logging of these searches may be tricky
8) Do you have the knowledge what your competition uses to get customers in? Do you sound the same or do you have nyances on your descriptions?

10) Make your site friendly for mobile devices
11) Keep your response headers up-to-date with correct codes
12) Don't redirect for no reason.
13) Identify and get rid of duplicate content. There are webcrawler tools for this

Searchengine logic:
-If you get referenced by CNN, it makes you important
-If you reference CNN aggressively, it tells that CNN is important to you
-If some page is referenced from anywhere a lot, the page is going to raise your ranking for the whole site.

General notes:
-Are you applying for international, local or app store search engines?

Important metrics are:
1) Organic traffic		== Traffic that is redirected from search results
2) Click-through rate (CTR)	== Ratio of how often your link is clicked when seen.
  "If your CTR is low, it may mean your title or meta description is not engaging, or the content isnâ€™t relevant to what the user is looking for"
  -Get the metrics using Google Search Console: Performance
3) Exit rate			== Ratio of page viewers see this page as the last page of your site before leaving
4) Pages per session		== How many pages are visited on arrival to your site
5) Average page load time	== This one is important especially outside of finland.
6) Core Web Vitals		== Some google service. Google more
7) Backlinks and referring domains	== If someone with good reputation is linking your page, it's valuable
8) Top keywords ranked		== Volume that is attracted based on your keywords
9) Pages crawled per day	== If crawling is made fast, rankings go up

Debateable metrics:
1) Conversions			== While this doesn't always tell the whole story, when doing sales, generating sales is important IMO.
2) Bounce rate			== When a person lands on your page, they leave without clicking any links. What if they found what they were looking for, and left.

-While this seems useless for webdevelopment perspective, this may give some insight to applying for jobs.
